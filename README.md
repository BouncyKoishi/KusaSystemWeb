# Kusa-System-Web

A Vue.js project coding a hangout game called Kusa System.

The original Kusa System is a subsystem on the TencentQQ Bot called [ChuCaoQi](https://github.com/BouncyKoishi/ChuCaoQi-Bot). This project creates a new hangout game modelled on the ChuCaoQi's Kusa System, with extensive modifications.

The project is still in the early stages of development, and the current goal is to replicate the functionality that already exists in the ChuCaoQi's Kusa System, and to speed up the game significantly.
